      "content":"A typical phishing trick is to send users a link that seems as if it might be heading to one website, but instead, it directs you to a malicious alternative; this can be accomplished by showing you the text of a trustworthy site, while the link itself sends you to a more malevolent option. For example, the link you click on may say google.com, but thanks to tricky web coding, the results may direct you to a different site designed to harvest your information. This trick can easily be identified by holding down on the link with your finger to see what web link it truly directs itself towards. Depending on the smartphone and mobile browser you are using, the true link will typically be displayed in a pop-up dialog. Remember to eye the web link carefully before you click on it. Using slight typos in a web link is an efficient way to make you think you are secure when you are really at risk – heading to y0urbank.com’ instead of ‘yourbank.com.’ Other keywords may even be added to the web address to create a plausible-sounding, but unofficial, link such as yourbanklogin.com.",

      "content":"Scammers posing as tech assistants want you to think your machine is infected with a virus or has some other significant issue. They want you to pay for tech support services you don't require in order to solve an imaginary problem. Because they are aware that those methods of payment can be challenging to reverse, they frequently request that you wire money, load money into a gift card, prepaid card, or cash reload card, use cryptocurrencies, or utilize a money transfer app. Tech support con artists employ a wide range of strategies to deceive customers. You can avoid falling victim to fraud by recognizing these tricks. They will employ several strategies, including phone calls, pop-up alerts, and web advertisements.",
